#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds the engine's Python environment (architecture section 3.3): a venv
# from the system Python with every third-party dependency of the engine,
# from the hashed lock and nothing else, and a .pth file that puts the
# engine's own source on the venv's path. provision.sh runs it as root inside
# the golden image's builder VM, and the docker smoke runs it on a plain
# ubuntu:24.04 container, so both build the same thing.
#
#   build-engine-env.sh <lock> <venv directory> <engine source directory>
#
# The engine source is NOT copied: it lives on the runtime disk
# (/opt/invisible-dots/engine), which is not mounted when the golden image is
# built. The .pth names the directory, and Python skips a .pth entry that does
# not exist yet. Only wheels are installed, so no build script of any
# third-party package runs, which is what makes it safe to run as root.
