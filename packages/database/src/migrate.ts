/**
 * Applies the plain SQL migrations in `migrations/` in file name order
 * (architecture section 9.1). Each file runs in its own transaction and is
 * recorded in `schema_migrations` in that same transaction, so a failed
 * migration leaves nothing half applied.
 *
 * Every transaction first takes a transaction-scoped advisory lock and only
 * then checks whether its file is already recorded. Two servers migrating
 * one external PostgreSQL at once therefore apply each file once; on PGlite
 * the lock is uncontended because its transactions already run one at a
 * time, but it is the same statement on both. A transaction-scoped lock is
 * used rather than a session lock because it needs no dedicated connection
 * and cannot be left held by a failure between lock and unlock.
