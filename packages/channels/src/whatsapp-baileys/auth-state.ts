/**
 * Baileys' authentication state over the encrypted secrets of the Dot, instead of the plaintext JSON files of
 * its multi-file helper. The state is the linked device's identity and its Signal keys: whoever holds it is
 * that WhatsApp account, which makes it worth more than a bot token. It is kept as one encrypted secret for the
 * credentials and one per group of keys (`SignalKeyGroup` names the groups, and the typecheck made with the
 * library installed proves the list is the library's own), under the Dot's id like
 * every secret, so it is deleted with the channel and the Dot and never reaches the guest.
 *
 * The whole state lives in memory while the connection is open; a change is written before `set` resolves,
 * because a Signal ratchet that moved and was not saved cannot be taken back. The credentials and every group
 * that changed go in one transaction (`ChannelSecrets.putAll`), so a crash leaves the state as it was or as it
 * is now, never a step apart; and once the channel or its Dot is deleted nothing is written back.
