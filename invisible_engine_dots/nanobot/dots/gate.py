"""The Dot's policy on every tool call (architecture 8.4).

It is the one approval system: the decision comes from the permission map the
host pushed in the Dot config, which carries a decision for every permission
the host knows. The runner applies it at the one boundary every execution path
crosses, on the arguments the tool would run with and before anything runs.

- allow: the call runs;
- deny: the call does not run and the model is told why; a tool with no
  permission, or a permission missing from the map, is denied;
- ask: the call is recorded with its full arguments and the host is asked, in
  one transaction, and the turn ends (the runner yields). Nothing waits in
  memory. Once approved, the engine tells the session to make the call again,
  and the one call an "ask" lets through is that one: in a turn of the same
  session, the same tool, exactly the approved arguments, once (status granted,
  then running);
- skipped: the calls of the same response that come after a parked one are not
  run either, and say so.

With no config or no store, every call is denied: the gate fails closed.

The gate decides a call that was prepared: one to a tool the turn was not offered, or
with arguments that do not fit the tool, fails before it and never reaches it. Its
`tool.called` says decision "allow" and ok false, as the contract reported such a call
(the gate only ever recorded a decision for a call that reached it). The denial of a
tool outside the permission table (permissions.py) is for a gate asked about one directly.

`close_open_calls` is the other half of what the gate recorded: a call that was
left without a result (the process or the turn ended) is closed by what the
database holds for it.
