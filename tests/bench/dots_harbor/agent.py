"""A Harbor agent that is a Dot doing a task: the instruction goes to the Dot as a task, through the API.

    harbor run -e dots_harbor.environment:DotEnvironment -a dots_harbor.agent:DotAgent ...

The Dot works in its own computer with its own tools, as it does for a person; Harbor's verifier then
grades what it left. The task's paths are moved under /home/dot/bench (paths.py), in the instruction too,
and the Dot is told where it works.
