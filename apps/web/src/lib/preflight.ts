/**
 * What the create form checks before a Dot is made: that the control plane answers, that its database does and that
 * an OpenRouter key is stored (`GET /api/health`), and then what the host needs for a Dot's computer to run, which is
 * the report of `invisible-dots doctor` (`GET /api/doctor`: QEMU, the accelerator, disk, the images). The list is the
 * one the panel draws, item by item.
 *
 * The doctor's own `openrouter` row is left out: the key is one fact and `GET /api/health` is the web's one reader
 * of it, so the panel would otherwise say it twice.
