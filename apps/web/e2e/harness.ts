/**
 * The real control plane and the real web server, for the browser tests: `startServer` of apps/api in this process
 * on a temporary INVISIBLE_DOTS_HOME (PGlite), with FakeDriver for the VM layer, so a test can drive what a Dot's
 * computer does (`driver.guestOf(id)`); and the web client as the product ships and runs it: the built standalone
 * server (`.next/standalone/apps/web/server.js` with its copied static files) started by the CLI's own `startWebServer`,
 * with the reduced environment `invisible-dots server` gives it (`webEnvironment`), pointed at that control plane.
 * The channels run for real too, on what the hub's own tests use: the Telegram adapter talks to a Bot API server of this
 * process (`bots`) and the WhatsApp adapter to a connection a test plays (`whatsapp`). Only `npm run build --workspace
 * @invisible-dots/web` has to have run before (the standalone build, not only `next build`).
